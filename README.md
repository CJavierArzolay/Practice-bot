# Botly.py
A bot made in 3 days with python (apart from ending up without learning much 😭) and what **I think** it does is:

- send a message every so often
- add & multiply (because i am too lazy to do more intersting features, _~~also what I wanted to do is the first feature :3~~_)

### thanks for read & have a nice day

###### (no, I did not do the gitignore with the bot, I misspelled it and I meant to "i finished the creation of the bot", excuse me for my impulsiveness and bad english 🤐👉👈)
